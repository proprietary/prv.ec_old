	  <article>
		<p>
		  prv.ec stores the urls you enter here in encrypted
		  ciphertext. both encryption and decryption is done right
		  here, in your browser. even if we wanted to, we could not
		  tell where your link goes to, or if it's even a url for that
		  matter. this is in contrast to all other popular url
		  shortening services which collect all kinds of data about
		  the visitors to their links. we don't log anything about
		  users who visit links (you can check&mdash;the server
		  software
		  is <a href="https://github.com/proprietary/prv.ec">free and
		  open source software</a>), not that it matters much since we
		  have no way of knowing where your links go to.
		</p>
		<p>
		  the shortened url itself contains the password to decrypt
		  the url, so anyone you share the link with who clicks on it
		  will be redirected to the intended url. anything in the url
		  after the "#" character is not visible to our servers and
		  remains entirely client-side. in your shortened url, some of
		  the characters after the "#" represent your
		  password. several techniques are used to keep this password
		  short while still preserving some level of secrecy. this
		  includes performing an expensive calculation which may
		  take <em>several</em> seconds and heat up your phone before
		  the original url can be successfully decrypted and
		  redirected for you. try it out!
